# LeetCodeProblems

Hi all! 

In this repository I have uploaded two files that are containers of LeetCode problems' solutions in the languages I use the most (Python and C++).
The files are simply a series of functions, where each function is a solution to a problem whose name is the name of the function.
I have also sometimes written the  runtime and memory of the solution.

Thank you and have fun!
